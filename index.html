<b><h2>Ecosystem</h2></b>
<hr>

<hr>
<p><h4>An ecosystem (or ecological system) consists of all the organisms and the physical environment with which they interact. These biotic
    and a biotic components are linked together through nutrient cycle and energy flows. Energy enters the system through photosynthesis
    and is incorporated into plant tissue. By feeding on plants and on one another, animal play an important role in the movement of 
    matter and energy through the system. They also influence the quantity of plant microbial biomass present. By breaking down dead
    organic matter, decomposers release carbon back to the atmosphere and facilitate nutrients cycling by converting nutrients stored 
    in dead biomass back to a form that can be readily used by plants and microbes.</h4></p>
    
    <p><h4>Ecosystems are controlled by external and internal factors. External factors such as climate, parent material which forms the soil
        and topography, controll the overall structure of an ecosystem but are not themselves influenced by the ecosystem. Internal factors
        are controlled, for example, by decomposition, root competition, shading, disturbance, succession, and the types of species 
        present. While the resource input are generally controlled by external processes, the availability of these resources within
        the ecosystem is controlled by internal factors. Therefore, internal factor not only control ecosystem processes but are also
        controlled by them.</h4></p>

    <p><h4>Ecosystem are dynamic entities--they are subject to periodic disturbances and are always in the process of recovering form
        some past disturbance. The tendency of an ecosystem to remain close to its equilibrium state, despite that disturbance, is 
        termed its resistance. The capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to retain
        essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks is termed its ecological resilience. Ecosystem can be studied 
        through a variety of approaches--theoretical studies, studies monitoring specific ecosystems over long periods of time, those
        that look at differences between ecosystems to elucidate how they work and direct manipulative experimentation. Biomes are 
        general classes or categories of ecosystems. However, there is no clear distinction between biomes and ecosystem. Ecosystem 
        classification are specific kinds of ecological classifications that consider all four elements of the defination of ecosystems:
        a biotic component, an abiotic complex, the interactions between and wuth in them, and the physical space occupy.</h4></p>

    <p><h4>Ecosystems provide a variety of goods and services upon which people depend. Ecosystem good include the "tangible, material
        products" of ecosystem processes such as water, food, fuel, construction material, and medicinal plants. Ecosystems services,
        on the other hand, are generally "improvments in the condition or location of things of value". These include things like the 
        maintenance of hydrological cycles, cleaning air and water, the maintenance of oxygen in the atmosphere, crop pollination 
        and even things like beauty, inspiration and opportunities for research. Many Ecosystems become degraded through human impacts
        such as soil loss, air and water pollution, habitat fragmentation, water diversion, fire suppression, and introduced species 
        and invasive species. These threats can lead to abrupt transformation of the ecosystem or to gradual disruption of biotic 
        processes and degradation of abiotic conditions of the ecosystems. Once the original ecosystem has lost its defining features,
        it is considered "collasped". Ecosystem retoration is thought to contribute to all 17 Sustainable Developments Goals.</h4></p>

    <b><h2>Defination</h2></b>
    <hr>
    <p><h4>An ecosystem (or ecological system) consists of all the orfanisms and the abiotic pools (for physical environment) with which 
        they interact. The biotic and abiotic components are linked together through nutrient cycle and energy flows.</h4></p>

    <p><h4>"Ecosystem processes" are the transfer of energy and material from one pool to another. Ecosystem processes are known to
        "take place at a wide range of scales". Therefore, the correct scale of study depends on the question asked.</h4></p>

    <b><h2>Origin and development of the term </h2></b>
    <hr>
    <p><h4>The term "ecosystem" was first used in 1935 in a publication by British ecologist Artur Roy Clapham, who came up with the 
        word at Tansley's request. Tansley devised the concept to draw attention to the importance of transfers of material between
        oraganisms and their environment. He later refinded the term, describing it as "The whole system, ... including not only 
        the organism-complex, but also the whole complex, but also the whole complex of physical factors forming what we call the 
        environment". Tansley regarded ecosystems not only simply as natural units, but as "mental isolates". Tansley later definded 
        the spatial extent of ecosystems using the term "ecotope".</h4></p>

    <p><h4>G. Evelyn Hutchinson, a limnologist who was a comtemporary Tansley's, combined Charles Elton's about trophic ecology with
        those of Russian geochemist Vladimir Vernadsky. As a result, he suggest that mineral nutrient availability in a lake limited 
        algal production. This would, in turn, limit the abundance of animals that feed on algae. Raymond Lindeman took these ideas
        further to suggest that the flow of energy through the lake was the primary driver of the ecosystems. This allowed them to 
    study the flow of energy and material through ecological systems.</h4></p>

    <h2>Ecosystem Processes</h2>
    <hr>
    <hr>
    <b><h2>External and internal Material</h2></b>
    <hr>
    <img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop/Ecosystem Processes.png"
    <p><h4>Ecosystems are controlled by both external and internal factors. External factors, also called state factors, control the overall structure of
        an ecosystem and the way things work within it, but are not themselves influenced by the ecosystem. On broad geographic scales, climate
        is the factor that "most strongly determines ecosystem processes and structure". Climate determines the biome in which the
        ecosystem is embedded. Rainfall patterns and seasonal temperatures influence photosynthesis and thereby determine the amount of
        energy available to the ecosystem.</h4></p>

        <p><h4>Parent material determines the nature of the soil in an ecosystem, and influences the supply of mineral nutrients. Topography also controls
            ecosystem processes by affecting things like microclimate, soil development and the movement of water through a system. For example,
            ecosystems can be quite different if situated in a small depression on the landscape, versus one present on an adjacent steep
            hillside.</h4></p>

        <p><h4>Other external factors that play an important role in ecosystem functioning include time and potential biota, the organisms that are present
            in a region and could potentially occupy a particular site. Ecosystems in similar environments that are located in different parts of the world
            can end up doing things very differently simply because they have different pools of species present. The introduction of non-native
            species can cause substantial shifts in ecosystem function.</h4></p>

    <p><h4>Unlike external factors, internal factors in ecosystems not only control ecosystem processes but are also controlled by them. While the
        resource inputs are generally controlled by external processes like climate and parent material, the availability of these resources within
        the ecosystem is controlled by internal factors like decomposition, root competition or shading.  Other factors like disturbance,
        succession or the types of species present are also internal factors.</h4></p>

        <b><h2>Primary Production</h2></b>
    <hr>
    <img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop/Primary Production.png"
    <p><h4>Primary production is the production of organic matter from inorganic carbon sources. This mainly occurs
        through photosynthesis. The energy incorporated through this process supports life on earth, while the
        carbon makes up much of the organic matter in living and dead biomass, soil carbon and fossil fuels. It also
        drives the carbon cycle, which influences global climate via the greenhouse effect.</h4></p>

    <p><h4>Through the process of photosynthesis, plants capture energy from light and use it to combine carbon dioxide
        and water to produce carbohydrates and oxygen. The photosynthesis carried out by all the plants in an
        ecosystem is called the gross primary production (GPP). About half of the gross GPP is respired by
        plants in order to provide the energy that supports their growth and maintenance. The remainder, that
        portion of GPP that is not used up by respiration, is known as the net primary production (NPP). Total
        photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors. These include the amount of light available, the
        amount of leaf area a plant has to capture light (shading by other plants is a major limitation of
        photosynthesis), the rate at which carbon dioxide can be supplied to the chloroplasts to support
        photosynthesis, the availability of water, and the availability of suitable temperatures for carrying out
        photosynthesis.</h4></p>

    <b><h2>Energy Flow</h2></b>
    <hr>
<p><h4>Energy and carbon enter ecosystems through photosynthesis, are incorporated into living tissue, transferred to other organisms that feed on the living and dead plant matter, and
    eventually released through respiration. The carbon and energy incorporated into plant tissues (net primary production) is either consumed by animals while the plant is
    alive, or it remains uneaten when the plant tissue dies and becomes detritus. In terrestrial ecosystems, the vast majority of the net primary production ends up being broken down
    by decomposers. The remainder is consumed by animals while still alive and enters the plant-based trophic system. After plants and animals die, the organic matter contained in
    them enters the detritus-based trophic system.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Ecosystem respiration is the sum of respiration by all living organisms (plants, animals, and decomposers) in the ecosystem.  Net ecosystem production is the difference
    between gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration. In the absence of disturbance, net ecosystem production is equivalent to the net carbon accumulation in
    the ecosystem.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Energy can also be released from an ecosystem through disturbances such as wildfire or transferred to other ecosystems (e.g., from a forest to a stream to a lake) by erosion.</h4></p>

<p><h4>In aquatic systems, the proportion of plant biomass that gets consumed by herbivores is much higher than in terrestrial systems. In trophic systems, photosynthetic organisms
    are the primary producers. The organisms that consume their tissues are called primary consumers or secondary producers—herbivores. Organisms which feed on microbes
    (bacteria and fungi) are termed microbivores. Animals that feed on primary consumers—carnivores—are secondary consumers. Each of these constitutes a trophic level.</h4></p>
        
<p><h4>The sequence of consumption—from plant to herbivore, to carnivore—forms a food chain. Real systems are much more complex than this—organisms will generally feed on more
    than one form of food, and may feed at more than one trophic level. Carnivores may capture some prey that is part of a plant-based trophic system and others that are part of a
    detritus-based trophic system (a bird that feeds both on herbivorous grasshoppers and earthworms, which consume detritus). Real systems, with all these complexities, form food
    webs rather than food chains.</h4></p>

<b><h2>Decomposition</h2></b>
<hr>
<img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop/Decomposistion.png"
<p><h4>The carbon and nutrients in dead organic matter are broken down
    by a group of processes known as decomposition. This releases
    nutrients that can then be re-used for plant and microbial production
    and returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere (or water) where it can
    be used for photosynthesis. In the absence of decomposition, the
    dead organic matter would accumulate in an ecosystem, and
    nutrients and atmospheric carbon dioxide would be depleted.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Decomposition processes can be separated into three categories—
    leaching, fragmentation and chemical alteration of dead material. As water moves through dead organic matter, it dissolves and carries with it the water-soluble components.
    These are then taken up by organisms in the soil, react with mineral soil, or are transported beyond the confines of the ecosystem (and are considered lost to it). Newly
    shed leaves and newly dead animals have high concentrations of water-soluble components and include sugars, amino acids and mineral nutrients. Leaching is more important in
    wet environments and less important in dry ones.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Fragmentation processes break organic material into smaller pieces, exposing new surfaces for colonization by microbes. Freshly shed leaf litter may be inaccessible due to an
    outer layer of cuticle or bark, and cell contents are protected by a cell wall. Newly dead animals may be covered by an exoskeleton. Fragmentation processes, which break through
    these protective layers, accelerate the rate of microbial decomposition. Animals fragment detritus as they hunt for food, as does passage through the gut. Freeze-thaw
    cycles and cycles of wetting and drying also fragment dead material.</h4></p>

<p><h4>The chemical alteration of the dead organic matter is primarily achieved through bacterial and fungal action. Fungal hyphae produce enzymes that can break through the tough
    outer structures surrounding dead plant material. They also produce enzymes that break down lignin, which allows them access to both cell contents and the nitrogen in the lignin.
    Fungi can transfer carbon and nitrogen through their hyphal networks and thus, unlike bacteria, are not dependent solely on locally available resources.</h4></p>

<b><h2>Decomposistion Rates</h2></b>
<hr>
<p><h4>Decomposition rates vary among ecosystems. The rate of decomposition is governed by three sets of factors—the physical environment (temperature, moisture, and soil
    properties), the quantity and quality of the dead material available to decomposers, and the nature of the microbial community itself. Temperature controls the rate of
    microbial respiration; the higher the temperature, the faster the microbial decomposition occurs. Temperature also affects soil moisture, which affects decomposition. Freeze-thaw
    cycles also affect decomposition—freezing temperatures kill soil microorganisms, which allows leaching to play a more important role in moving nutrients around. This can be
    especially important as the soil thaws in the spring, creating a pulse of nutrients that become available.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Decomposition rates are low under very wet or very dry conditions. Decomposition rates are highest in wet, moist conditions with adequate levels of oxygen. Wet soils tend to
    become deficient in oxygen (this is especially true in wetlands), which slows microbial growth. In dry soils, decomposition slows as well, but bacteria continue to grow (albeit at a
    slower rate) even after soils become too dry to support plant growth.</h4></p>

<b><h2>Dynamics and resilience</h2></b>
<hr>
<img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop/Dyamic.png"
<p><h4>Ecosystems are dynamic entities. They are subject to periodic disturbances and are always in the process of recovering from past disturbances. When a perturbation
    occurs, an ecosystem responds by moving away from its initial state. The tendency of an ecosystem to remain close to its equilibrium state, despite that disturbance, is termed its
    resistance. The capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and
    feedbacks is termed its ecological resilience. Resilience thinking also includes humanity as an integral part of the biosphere where we are dependent on ecosystem services
    for our survival and must build and maintain their natural capacities to withstand shocks and disturbances. Time plays a central role over a wide range, for example, in the slow
    development of soil from bare rock and the faster recovery of a community from disturbance.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Disturbance also plays an important role in ecological processes. F. Stuart Chapin and coauthors define disturbance as "a relatively discrete event in time that removes plant
    biomass". This can range from herbivore outbreaks, treefalls, fires, hurricanes, floods, glacial advances, to volcanic eruptions. Such disturbances can cause large changes
    in plant, animal and microbe populations, as well as soil organic matter content. Disturbance is followed by succession, a "directional change in ecosystem structure and
    functioning resulting from biotically driven changes in resource supply."</h4></p>

<p><h4>The frequency and severity of disturbance determine the way it affects ecosystem function. A major disturbance like a volcanic eruption or glacial advance and retreat leave
    behind soils that lack plants, animals or organic matter. Ecosystems that experience such disturbances undergo primary succession. A less severe disturbance like forest fires, 
    hurricanes or cultivation result in secondary succession and a faster recovery. More severe and more frequent disturbance result in longer recovery times.</h4></p>

<p><h4>From one year to another, ecosystems experience variation in their biotic and abiotic environments. A drought, a colder than usual winter, and a pest outbreak all are short-term
    variability in environmental conditions. Animal populations vary from year to year, building up during resource-rich periods and crashing as they overshoot their food supply.
    Longer-term changes also shape ecosystem processes. For example, the forests of eastern North America still show legacies of cultivation which ceased in 1850 when large areas
    were reverted to forests. Another example is the methane production in eastern Siberian lakes that is controlled by organic matter which accumulated during the
    Pleistocene.</h4></p>

<b><h2>Nutrient Cycle</h2></b>
<hr>
<img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop/Nutrient cycle.png"
<p><h4>Ecosystems continually exchange energy and carbon with the wider environment. Mineral nutrients, on the
    other hand, are mostly cycled back and forth between plants, animals, microbes and the soil. Most nitrogen
    enters ecosystems through biological nitrogen fixation, is deposited through precipitation, dust, gases or is
    applied as fertilizer. Most terrestrial ecosystems are nitrogen-limited in the short term making nitrogen
    cycling an important control on ecosystem production. Over the long term, phosphorus availability can
    also be critical.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Macronutrients which are required by all plants in large quantities include the primary nutrients (which are
    most limiting as they are used in largest amounts): Nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium. Secondary major
    nutrients (less often limiting) include: Calcium, magnesium, sulfur. Micronutrients required by all plants in small
    quantities include boron, chloride, copper, iron, manganese, molybdenum, zinc. Finally, there are also
    beneficial nutrients which may be required by certain plants or by plants under specific environmental
    conditions: aluminum, cobalt, iodine, nickel, selenium, silicon, sodium, vanadium.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Until modern times, nitrogen fixation was the major source of nitrogen for ecosystems. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria
    either live symbiotically with plants or live freely in the soil. The energetic cost is high for plants that support
    nitrogen-fixing symbionts—as much as 25% of gross primary production when measured in controlled
    conditions. Many members of the legume plant family support nitrogen-fixing symbionts. Some cyanobacteria
    are also capable of nitrogen fixation. These are phototrophs, which carry out photosynthesis. Like other nitrogen-fixing bacteria, they can either be free-living or have symbiotic
    relationships with plants. Other sources of nitrogen include acid deposition produced through the combustion of fossil fuels, ammonia gas which evaporates from agricultural
    fields which have had fertilizers applied to them, and dust. Anthropogenic nitrogen inputs account for about 80% of all nitrogen fluxes in ecosystems.</h4></p>

<p><h4>When plant tissues are shed or are eaten, the nitrogen in those tissues becomes available to animals and microbes. Microbial decomposition releases nitrogen compounds from
    dead organic matter in the soil, where plants, fungi, and bacteria compete for it. Some soil bacteria use organic nitrogen-containing compounds as a source of carbon, and
    release ammonium ions into the soil. This process is known as nitrogen mineralization. Others convert ammonium to nitrite and nitrate ions, a process known as nitrification. Nitric
    oxide and nitrous oxide are also produced during nitrification. Under nitrogen-rich and oxygen-poor conditions, nitrates and nitrites are converted to nitrogen gas, a process
    known as denitrification.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Mycorrhizal fungi which are symbiotic with plant roots, use carbohydrates supplied by the plants and in return transfer phosphorus and nitrogen compounds back to the plant
    roots. This is an important pathway of organic nitrogen transfer from dead organic matter to plants. This mechanism may contribute to more than 70 Tg of annually
    assimilated plant nitrogen, thereby playing a critical role in global nutrient cycling and ecosystem function.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Phosphorus enters ecosystems through weathering. As ecosystems age this supply diminishes, making phosphorus-limitation more common in older landscapes (especially in the
    tropics). Calcium and sulfur are also produced by weathering, but acid deposition is an important source of sulfur in many ecosystems. Although magnesium and
    manganese are produced by weathering, exchanges between soil organic matter and living cells account for a significant portion of ecosystem fluxes. Potassium is primarily cycled
    between living cells and soil organic matter.</h4></p>

<b><h2>Function and biodiversity</h2></b>
<hr>
<img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop/Function.png"
<p><h4>Biodiversity plays an important role in ecosystem functioning. Ecosystem processes are driven by the species in an ecosystem,
    the nature of the individual species, and the relative abundance of organisms among these species. Ecosystem processes are the net
    effect of the actions of individual organisms as they interact with their environment. Ecological theory suggests that in order to coexist,
    species must have some level of limiting similarity—they must be different from one another in some fundamental way, otherwise, one
    species would competitively exclude the other. Despite this, the cumulative effect of additional species in an ecosystem is not linear:
    additional species may enhance nitrogen retention, for example. However, beyond some level of species richness, additional species
    species.</h4></p>

<p><h4>The addition (or loss) of species that are ecologically similar to those already present in an ecosystem tends to only have a small effect on
    ecosystem function. Ecologically distinct species, on the other hand, have a much larger effect. Similarly, dominant species have a large
    effect on ecosystem function, while rare species tend to have a small effect. Keystone species tend to have an effect on ecosystem
    function that is disproportionate to their abundance in an ecosystem.</h4></p>

<p><h4>An ecosystem engineer is any organism that creates, significantly modifies, maintains or destroys a habitat.</h4></p>
<b><h2>Study approaches</h2></b>
<hr>
<hr>
<b><h2>Ecosystem ecology</h2></b>
<hr>
<p><h2>Ecosystem ecology is the "study of the interactions between organisms and their environment as an integrated system". The size of
    ecosystems can range up to ten orders of magnitude, from the surface layers of rocks to the surface of the planet.</h2></p>

<p><h4>The Hubbard Brook Ecosystem Study started in 1963 to study the White Mountains in New Hampshire. It was the first successful attempt to
    study an entire watershed as an ecosystem. The study used stream chemistry as a means of monitoring ecosystem properties, and
    developed a detailed biogeochemical model of the ecosystem.  Long-term research at the site led to the discovery of acid rain in North
    America in 1972. Researchers documented the depletion of soil cations (especially calcium) over the next several decades.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Ecosystems can be studied through a variety of approaches—theoretical studies, studies monitoring specific ecosystems over long periods
    of time, those that look at differences between ecosystems to elucidate how they work and direct manipulative experimentation. Studies
    can be carried out at a variety of scales, ranging from whole-ecosystem studies to studying microcosms or mesocosms (simplified
    representations of ecosystems). American ecologist Stephen R. Carpenter has argued that microcosm experiments can be "irrelevant
    and diversionary" if they are not carried out in conjunction with field studies done at the ecosystem scale. In such cases, microcosm
    experiments may fail to accurately predict ecosystem-level dynamics.</h4></p>

<b><h2>Classifications</h2></b>
<hr>
<p><h4>Biomes are general classes or categories of ecosystems. However, there is no clear distinction between biomes and ecosystems.
    Biomes are always defined at a very general level. Ecosystems can be described at levels that range from very general (in which case the
    names are sometimes the same as those of biomes) to very specific, such as "wet coastal needle-leafed forests".</h4></p>

<p><h4>Biomes vary due to global variations in climate. Biomes are often defined by their structure: at a general level, for example, tropical forests, temperate grasslands, and arctic
    tundra. There can be any degree of subcategories among ecosystem types that comprise a biome, e.g., needle-leafed boreal forests or wet tropical forests. Although
    ecosystems are most commonly categorized by their structure and geography, there are also other ways to categorize and classify ecosystems such as by their level of human
    impact (see anthropogenic biome), or by their integration with social processes or technological processes or their novelty (e.g. novel ecosystem). Each of these taxonomies of
    ecosystems tends to emphasize different structural or functional properties. None of these is the “best” classification.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Ecosystem classifications are specific kinds of ecological classifications that consider all four elements of the definition of ecosystems: a biotic component, an abiotic complex, the
    interactions between and within them, and the physical space they occupy. Different approaches to ecological classifications have been developed in terrestrial, freshwater and
    marine disciplines.</h4></p>

<b><h2>Examples</h2></b>

<p><h4>The following articles are examples of ecosystems for particular regions, zones or conditions:</h4></p>

<li>Aquatic ecosystem</li>                             <li>Lake ecosystem (lentic ecosystem)</li>               <li>River ecosystem (lotic ecosystem)</li>
<li>Boreal ecosystem</li>                              <li>Large marine ecosystem</li>                          <li>Terrestrial ecosystem</li>
<li>Freshwater ecosystem</li>                          <li>Marine ecosystem</li>                                <li>Urban ecosystem</li>
<li>Groundwater-dependent ecosystems</li>              <li>Montane ecosystem</li>

<b><h2>Human interactions with ecosystems</h2></b>
<hr>
<hr>
<p><h4>Human activities are important in almost all ecosystems. Although humans exist and operate within ecosystems, their cumulative effects are large enough to influence external
    factors like climate.</h4></p>
<b><h2>Ecosystem goods and services</h2></b>
<hr>
<img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop/Ecosystem goods.png"
<p><h4>Ecosystems provide a variety of goods and services upon which people depend. Ecosystem goods include the "tangible, material
    products" of ecosystem processes such as water, food, fuel, construction material, and medicinal plants. They also include less
    tangible items like tourism and recreation, and genes from wild plants and animals that can be used to improve domestic species.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Ecosystem services, on the other hand, are generally "improvements in the condition or location of things of value". These include
    things like the maintenance of hydrological cycles, cleaning air and water, the maintenance of oxygen in the atmosphere, crop pollination
    and even things like beauty, inspiration and opportunities for research. While material from the ecosystem had traditionally been
    recognized as being the basis for things of economic value, ecosystem services tend to be taken for granted.</h4></p>

<p><h4>The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment is an international synthesis by over 1000 of the world's leading biological scientists that analyzes
    the state of the Earth's ecosystems and provides summaries and guidelines for decision-makers. The report identified four major
    categories of ecosystem services: provisioning, regulating, cultural and supporting services. It concludes that human activity is having a
    significant and escalating impact on the biodiversity of the world ecosystems, reducing both their resilience and biocapacity. The report refers to natural systems as humanity's
    "life-support system", providing essential ecosystem services. The assessment measures 24 ecosystem services and concludes that only four have shown improvement over the
    last 50 years, 15 are in serious decline, and five are in a precarious condition.</h4></p>

<p><h4>The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) is an intergovernmental organization established to improve the interface between
    science and policy on issues of biodiversity and ecosystem services. It is intended to serve a similar role to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The conceptual
    framework of the IPBES includes six primary interlinked elements: nature, natures benefits to people, anthropogenic assets, institutions and governance systems and other
    indirect drivers of change, direct drivers of change, and good quality of life.</h4></p>

<b><h2>Ecosystem degradation and decline</h2></b>
<hr>
<img src="C:\Users\Admin\Desktop/Ecosystem degration.png"
<p><h4>As human population and per capita consumption grow, so do the resource demands imposed on ecosystems and the
    effects of the human ecological footprint. Natural resources are vulnerable and limited. The environmental impacts of
    anthropogenic actions are becoming more apparent. Problems for all ecosystems include: environmental pollution,
    climate change and biodiversity loss. For terrestrial ecosystems further threats include air pollution, soil degradation,
    and deforestation. For aquatic ecosystems threats also include unsustainable exploitation of marine resources (for
    example overfishing), marine pollution, microplastics pollution, the effects of climate change on oceans (e.g. warming
    and acidification), and building on coastal areas.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Many ecosystems become degraded through human impacts, such as soil loss, air and water pollution, habitat
    fragmentation, water diversion, fire suppression, and introduced species and invasive species.</h4></p>

<p><h4>These threats can lead to abrupt transformation of the ecosystem or to gradual disruption of biotic processes and
    degradation of abiotic conditions of the ecosystem. Once the original ecosystem has lost its defining features, it is
    considered collapsed (see also IUCN Red List of Ecosystems). Ecosystem collapse could be reversible and in this way differs from species extinction. Quantitative
    assessments of the risk of collapse are used as measures of conservation status and trends.</h4></p>

<b><h2>Ecosystem management</h2></b>

<p><h4>When natural resource management is applied to whole ecosystems, rather than single species, it is termed ecosystem management. Although definitions of ecosystem
    management abound, there is a common set of principles which underlie these definitions: A fundamental principle is the long-term sustainability of the production of goods and
    services by the ecosystem; "intergenerational sustainability [is] a precondition for management, not an afterthought". While ecosystem management can be used as part of a
    plan for wilderness conservation, it can also be used in intensively managed ecosystems (see, for example, agroecosystem and close to nature forestry).</h4></p>

<b><h2>Ecosystem restoration and sustainable development</h2></b>

<p><h4>Society is increasingly becoming aware that ecosystem services are not only limited but also that they are threatened by human activities. To help inform decision-makers, many
    ecosystem services are being assigned economic values, often based on the cost of replacement with anthropogenic alternatives. The ongoing challenge of prescribing economic
    value to nature, for example through biodiversity banking, is prompting transdisciplinary shifts in how we recognize and manage the environment, social responsibility, business
    opportunities, and our future as a species.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Ecosystem restoration will contribute to all 17 Sustainable Development Goals, in particular to SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG 14 (Life below
    water) and SDG 15 (Life on Land). Paragraph 27 of the Ministerial Declaration of the High-Level Political Forum on the SDGs held in July 2018 sets out
    commitments made to achieve sustainable management of all types of forests, halt deforestation, restore degraded forests, and substantially increase afforestation and
    reforestation globally by 2020.</h4></p>

<p><h4>Integrated conservation and development projects (ICDPs) aim to address conservation and human livelihood (sustainable development) concerns in developing countries
    together, rather than separately as was often done in the past.</h4></p>
